## Planning Story

I began planning the project with the wire frames user stories. I already had an idea of how I wanted the application to look and function. I created an ERD and build the backend from there.

I then created the components on the front-end with React. This was not too bad as many of the pages look the same for each user, but with different functionality. I just had to create conditionals on pages and the navigation bar for the different users to have access to the content that they need.
